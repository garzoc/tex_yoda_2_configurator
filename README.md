# Tex Yoda 2 open source configurator

This project is a open source version of Tex's proprietary web configurator for the model **tex yoda 2**

## Goal

The goal is to reverse engineer the .TEX binary format, in order to write a program that will allow keyboard owners to \
configure their keyboard without the web configurator. \
The benefit is that it will still be possible to configure the keyboard after ther servers disappear\
as well as adding features not present in the web version such a the
possiblity to modify you're current config.

## Repo structure

> 1. ./doc : Information on the binary format.
> 2. ./tex : Binary files used for analysis


## Missing features

* Macro support
* GUI
