# Tex Yoda 2 open source configurator

This project is a open source version of Tex's proprietary web configurator for the model **tex yoda 2**

## Goal

The goal is to reverse engineer the .TEX binary format, in order to write a program that will allow keyboard owners to
configure their keyboard without the proprietary web configurator.
Also to record the all known information of the binary format, which could be of
use when working with some of their other keyboard models.

## Repo structure

1. ./doc : Information on the binary format.
2. ./tex : Binary files used for analysis
