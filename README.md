# Tex Keyboard Configurator

This is an open source alternative to the proprietary web configurator\
for Tex keyboards, such as the `yoda2`.
> **This project is in no way affiliated with TEX Electronics.**

## Goal

The goal is to reverse engineer the .TEX binary format and develop a tools to allow keyboard owners to \
configure their keyboard locally without the web configurator.

It begun out of concern that the server may be shutdown in the future, and also\
providing a way for keyboard owners to improve the user experience with their\
own software and adding features such a persistent configuration.

Though this started out with the intention to only support the Yoda2,\
the aim is now to support the following keyboard models:

* Yoda2
* Shura
* Shinobi

## Repo structure

> 1. ./doc : Information on the binary format.
> 2. ./tex : Binary files used for analysis


## Missing features

* Macro support
* GUI
